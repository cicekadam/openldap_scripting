# openldap_scripting
Bash scripts for basic tasks and installation


Installing script is running smoothly. Let me know if you have a problem.

	$ git clone https://github.com/cicekadam/openldap_scripting.git
	$ bash openldap_scripting/instal.sh
	
It will ask you for openldap version, domain suffix, rootdn password, binddn password and firewalld status.
You may pass blank answers if you are not sure, it uses default values. 

I think of scripting for some basic tasks later. Keep following @cicekadam :)
